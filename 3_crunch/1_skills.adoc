=== Combinations

Frequently, a challenge can't be solved within the domain of a single skill,
so this is handled mechanically by taking the lowest value of all required
skills.

For instance, if a character has an opportunity to notice an obscure detail
about another character's revolver, such as a manufacturing defect in its
particular run, they would roll the lowest of Shoot, Lore, and Notice.

If the detail to be noticed is more ordinary, such as the safety catch being
engaged, they may only have to roll the lowest of Shoot and Notice.

However, if it's something that doesn't require an intimate understanding of
firearms or their maintenance, such as the word 'replica' being engraved on
the action, only Notice would be necessary.
