# Attributes

Every character in the Twilight Hell has four attributes that dictate their resilience to the horrors encountered there:

* Endurance
* Willpower
* Courage
* Conviction

A character has a number of points to allocate between these attributes equal to `( Clarity x 3 ) + 1`. This means that an average starting character should start with 10 points to allocate as they see fit.
