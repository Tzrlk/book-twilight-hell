## Tagging Consequences

Consequences are also Aspects, and as such, follow the same rules of invocation. If a Consequence has not yet been tagged during a Challenge, it can be tagged to add a die of the same type as the Consequence to the defense pool. As with Aspect tagging, the Consequence must make sense as something that would aid defense in the context of the Challenge taking place.

For example, a Character was recently assaulted with a wrench, and took a Minor Consequence to their Pain track to avoid being Taken Out. They are presented with a Challenge vs. their Madness to avoid being mind-controlled. Defending against an attack pool of 3 Madness and 1 Pain, They take their Clarity (3) and their Sanity (2), but to gain an edge, they tag their "headache" to get a Pain die to add to the pool.

It is important to note in the previous example, that since they added a Pain die to their defense pool, there are a total of 2 Pain die being rolled in the Challenge. If both Pain dice roll 6, and all other pools (Madness, Discipline) roll individual totals of 11 or less, Pain will Dominate, and the Character will automatically take a point of Stress to their Pain track.
