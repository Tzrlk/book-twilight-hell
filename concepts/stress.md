# Stress and Consequences

## Accumulation

1. Domination
2. Damage

### Domination

If the highest rolls during a Challenge belong to a particular dice group, the Character automatically gains a point of stress on the relevant stress track at the end of the Challenge.

## Recovery

1. Rest
2. Therapy

## Tagging Consequences

Consequences are also Aspects, and as such, follow the same rules of invocation. If a Consequence has not yet been tagged during a Challenge, it can be tagged to add a die of the same type as the Consequence to the defense pool. As with Aspect tagging, the Consequence must make sense as something that would aid defense in the context of the Challenge taking place.

For example, a Character was recently assaulted with a wrench, and took a Minor Consequence to their Pain track to avoid being Taken Out. They are presented with a Challenge vs. their Madness to avoid being mind-controlled. Defending against an attack pool of 3 Madness and 1 Pain, They take their Clarity (3) and their Sanity (2), but to gain an edge, they tag their "headache" to get a Pain die to add to the pool.

It is important to note in the previous example, that since they added a Pain die to their defense pool, there are a total of 2 Pain die being rolled in the Challenge. If both Pain dice roll 6, and all other pools (Madness, Discipline) roll individual totals of 11 or less, Pain will Dominate, and the Character will automatically take a point of Stress to their Pain track.

## Types

There are four types of Stress, one for each of a character's attributes.

| Attribute  | Stress     |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Endurance  | Pain       |
| Willpower  | Exhaustion |
| Courage    | Fear       |
| Conviction | Madness    |

### Exhaustion

All people get tired at some stage. They might never sleep, but they always get tired. As a story progresses, character will become exhausted with the constant physical and mental stress of their activities. As they get more exhausted, things get progressively harder.

Exhaustion is represented in play as a Stress track. The amount of boxes is equal to the Character's Clarity + Endurance.

#### Increased Effort

For a temporary boost, Exhaustion dice can be added to the player's side of the Challenge pool, thereby gaining an advantage. However, this increases the risk of Exhaustion dominating the Challenge. In addition, each dice added above the Character's Clarity increases their Exhaustion score by one.

#### Taking Damage

As mentioned in the other stress track descriptions, Minor Consequences take a toll when they disappear at the conclusion of a Scene. For each stress group, the Character takes a hit to their Exhaustion track for the next Scene of power equal to the number of Minor Consequences removed. This includes Minor Consequences from Exhaustion.

#### Recovery

A character can rest and sleep, removing an appropriate number of exhaustion points to the depth and length of the rest. Of course, if challenges occur during ones sleep, Exhaustion may need to be accumulated to survive them. Making it through the night may be a challenge in itself.
