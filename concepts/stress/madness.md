# Madness

The Twilight Hell is contradictary at the best of times. The minds trapped within its clutches struggle to make what sense they can of it. The slow erosion of ones' worldview causes a spiral of madness that ends in nothing good.

Madness is represented in play as a stress track, where the amount of boxes is equal to the Character's Clarity + Conviction skill.

## Accumulation

Fortunately, there are few ways to accumulate Madness. Unfortunately, those few are very pervasive, and easy to trigger.

### Domination

If the total result for all Madness dice in a given Challenge is higher than the total for any other type of die, Madness is said to "dominate" the Challenge. If this happens, the Character involved in the Challenge gains a single point of stress on their Madness track, with all the flow-on effects that go with it.

### Contradiction

Aspects are what keep a character safe, and provide consistency in a place where there is none. By declining a Compel on one of their Aspects, a contradiction in their worldview is created, and so they take a point of stress to their Madness track.

### Magic

Some types of magic have the ability to drive someone insane by shattering the protective anima of their ego. Such magical effects work as ordinary combat attacks that target the Madness stress track.

Other types of magic have a cost to them, and said cost is paid in stress on their Madness track. Though, this can frequently be mitigated by invoking one of their pre-existing or acquired delusions.

## Recovery

Recovering one's sanity and shoring up the Ego requires rest and some kind of re-framing. This re-framing can be pursued through careful therapy, radical catharsis, drug-fueled spirit quests, or a combination of all three.

That being said, since there is magic available to directly attack the underpinnings of a Character's sanity, there are also magical effects, and even some forms of technology, that can mitigate or even remove accrued stress and consequences.

### Stress

Accumulated stress on the Madness track represents a temporary disturbance to the Character's ego. That being the case, all points of stress are removed at the conclusion of a Scene.

### Minor Consequences

As with stress, Minor Consequences accrued during a Scene are removed at its conclusion. However, due to the mental exhaustion of regaining ones ego, the Character takes a hit to their Exhaustion stress track for the next Scene equal to the number of minor Consequences removed this way.

### Moderate Consequences

Moderate consequences cannot be as easily shaken-off than Minor ones. Some form of treatment is required to remove them, and even so, they aren't technically removed. During the course of treatment, the Character's worldview is stabilised by incorporating the Consequence into their personality to a greater or lesser degree. Mechanically, this means that an existing Aspect must be modified to include some part of the Consequence. Once this has been performed, the Moderate Consequence is downgraded to a Minor one.

### Severe Consequences

Even harder to remove than Moderate Consequences, Severe ones can be downgraded to Moderate with twice as much effort as converting a Moderate to a Minor.

## Benefits

Being a little crazy isn't always bad. The morphic nature of the Twilight Hell means that breaches to your Ego can run in your favour sometimes. Mechanically, this means that any of your consequences that have not been Tagged by the aggressor during a Challenge can instead be tagged by the defender.

Be wary of using this tactic too often, however, as dice added to your pool this way are considered Madness dice, and have a chance to Dominate the Challenge, thereby causing your Character to accumulate stress, and perhaps more Consequences.
