# Legacy

## Character Creation
Characters in the Twilight Hell are survivors, somehow they have managed to live through their lives, from conception all the way through the stages of awakening.

### Attributes
Each character is made up from the elements of creation, the different proportions defining their inherent strengths and weaknesses. While each person is made from a multiplicity of components, their makeup is represented by four aspects, each one corresponding to one of the elements. Each of these aspects is then broken into two facets: power and control.

|Aspect |Realm  |Power	|Control
|--
|Earth	|Physical	|Strength, Speed, Durability	|Agility, Precision
|Air	|Mental	|Intelligence, Wisdom, Willpower	|Intuition, Memory, Perception
|Water	|Social	|Presence, Manner, Charisma, Composure	|Subtlety, Empathy
|Fire	|Magical    |   |

Purchasing an extra level for an aspect costs 10 character points, however this is only potential, you must then justify this increase one way or another through play. If for some reason one of your aspects is reduced in game, you still retain the potential you purchased. Character points are never lost.

## Mechanics

### Component Training
If a character component's level is not currently equal to it's full potential, it may be increased by use and/or training. The amount of experience required to bolster the component depends on the level desired.

|Level  |Training Period
|--
|1	|Days
|2	|Weeks
|3	|Months
|4	|Quarters
|5	|Semesters
|6	|Years
|7	|Decades
|8	|Lifetimes

### Component Degradation
If a character component is neglected for too long, it may degrade and lose effective levels. Every relevant time period, an experience check must be made at a difficulty equal to the level of the component, and a . If the check fails, the component level drops by 1. These checks need only be made over time periods inversely proportional to the level of the component

|Level	|Degradation Period
|--
|1	|Centuries
|2	|Lifetimes
|3	|Decades
|4	|Years
|5	|Semesters
|6	|Quarters
|7	|Months
|8	|Weeks
