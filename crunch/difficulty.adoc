= Difficulty

Every action has a difficulty target. This is calculated by determining the
base difficulty of the action, and applying any immediate modifiers (usually
handled by aspects). If more than one modifier applies to the difficulty,
treat it like stress, in that if a value would overlap with another, increase
it by one until it doesn't. You only take the highest value, not the total.

The same method applies to multiple actions.
