# Exhaustion

All people get tired at some stage. They might never sleep, but they always get tired. As a story progresses, character will become exhausted with the constant physical and mental stress of their activities. As they get more exhausted, things get progressively harder.

Exhaustion is represented in play as a Stress track. The amount of boxes is equal to the Character's Clarity + Endurance.

## Accumulation

There are three ways a Character can accumulate Exhaustion. While it may seem apparent that one would accumulate it steadily throughout the day, most Exhaustion is accumulated simply from a blend of the following options.

### Increased Effort

For a temporary boost, Exhaustion dice can be added to the player's side of the Challenge pool, thereby gaining an advantage. However, this increases the risk of Exhaustion dominating the Challenge. In addition, each dice added above the Character's Clarity increases their Exhaustion score by one.

### Taking Damage

As mentioned in the other stress track descriptions, Minor Consequences take a toll when they disappear at the conclusion of a Scene. For each stress group, the Character takes a hit to their Exhaustion track for the next Scene of power equal to the number of Minor Consequences removed. This includes Minor Consequences from Exhaustion.

### Domination

If the highest rolls during a Challenge belong to Exhaustion dice, the Character automatically gains a point of Exhaustion at the end of the Challenge.

## Recovery

A character can rest and sleep, removing an appropriate number of exhaustion points to the depth and length of the rest. Of course, if challenges occur during ones sleep, Exhaustion may need to be accumulated to survive them. Making it through the night may be a challenge in itself.
