### Exhaustion
All people get tired at some stage. They might never sleep, but they always get tired. As a story progresses, character will become exhausted with the constant physical and mental stress of their activities. As they get more exhausted, things get progressively harder.

#### Accumulation
There are three ways a Character can accumulate Exhaustion. While it may seem apparent that one would accumulate it steadily throughout the day, most Exhaustion is accumulated simply from a blend of the following options.

##### Increased Effort
For a temporary boost, Exhaustion dice can be added to the players’ side of the Challenge pool, thereby gaining an advantage. However, this increases the risk of Exhaustion dominating the Challenge. In addition, each dice added above the Characters’ Clarity increases their Exhaustion score by one.

##### Taking Damage
Minor Consequences do not automatically disappear at the end of a Scene. As such, the only way to get rid of them is to accept a point of Exhaustion per Consequence removed.

##### Domination
If the highest rolls during a Challenge belong to Exhaustion dice, the Character automatically gains a point of Exhaustion at the end of the Challenge.

##### Consequence
Each point of Exhaustion adds to the Resistance in any Challenge the character participates in. This represents tasks becoming more difficult as the character tires. There is no limit to the amount of Exhaustion a character can have, but the GM can choose to pose a Challenge based entirely on Exhaustion when appropriate, to represent the threat of a Crash.

#### Recovery
A character can rest and sleep, removing an appropriate number of exhaustion points to the depth and length of the rest. Of course, if challenges occur during ones sleep, Exhaustion may need to be accumulated to survive them. Making it through the night may be a challenge in itself.
