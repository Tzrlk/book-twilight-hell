### Fear

Franklin D. Roosevelt said at his inaugural speech a sentence that seems perfectly apt to highlight the danger of Fear in the Twilight hell:

> “So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.”

The very fabric of reality is distorted by the Fear of those who dwell within it. Where the Stability of a Domain is weak, the effects of Fear, and the things that can manifest from it are stronger and more terrible.

#### Control
Almost everyone can control their own Fear to a certain extent. When in control of one’s Fear, the adrenaline and in the Twilight Hell, the very narrative helps a character overcome obstacles that would cripple and destroy them at any other point. A character always rolls a number of Fear dice in any Conflict equal to their current Fear level. This grants them a significant mechanical advantage as the story progresses, but increases the chance that Fear will Dominate in any given conflict, especially those against and involving Nightmares.

#### Lessening
Unfortunately, while Fear can make the impossible possible, it lends this aid with a dear price. When a point of Fear is accumulated, the Player must ‘lock’ an Aspect of theirs until their Fear reduces. As a character is consumed by their Fear, their personality simplifies, and their behaviour becomes more and more dictated by their Archetype and Nightmare Aspects.

#### Hollowing
Once all of a character’s Aspects are ‘locked’, and another point of Fear is accumulated, the character loses a point of Clarity and replaces it with a permanent Fear point. The two Aspects granted by the lost point of Clarity become twisted into fears, and can’t be ‘locked’ when Fear increases. When no more Clarity remains to be converted, the character becomes a Nightmare.
