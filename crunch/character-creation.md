# Character Creation

Everyone starts with the same stats, so the only real difference between any two starting characters are their Aspects and Talents. Answer the following few questions to determine the core parts of your Character, and what they need to struggle against to remain Aware.

## Crunch
Since everyone has the same starting stats, it makes sense to note them down first to provide context for character development.

* Clarity: 3
* Fear: 0/3
* Madness: 0/3

As a player, you start off as a “Lead Role” in the story, giving you Clarity 3. Note how the Clarity stat defines your maximum Fear and Madness; it is also your maximum refresh of Fate points. This maximum will increase as your Clarity increases.

## Aspects
Aspects are what gives your character free will, and also shackles them to be a slave of their Nature. All characters start with two Aspects, and get another two for every level of Clarity they have attained. The first two are thematic and required:

## Archetype / Role / Primary Concept
The most important thing to determine about your character, is their basic nature. If all free-will and complexity is stripped away, what defines the Nature of their existence? More often than not this will be their occupation, with just enough extra to make things interesting.
**Examples:** Gumshoe Detective, Reluctant Mob Enforcer, Crazy Homeless Guy, Honest Politician, etc.

## Nightmare / Nemesis / Fatal Flaw
The second most important thing to determine is what is your character afraid of. While this is mainly something that your character is always needing to overcome, it can be used creatively where your fears would justify particular areas of expertise.
**Examples:** Growing Old Before Your Time, Buried Alive And Conscious, Losing Your Mind Slowly, etc.

## Personality
The next set of Aspects are simply facets of your characters personality, and provide areas of expertise to draw on, and challenges to overcome. You get a number equal to twice your Clarity, so pick six.

## Narrative
…

## Moment of Clarity
At some point in your character’s mindless drudge through their existence, they saw or encountered something that broke them out of their reverie and showed them a faint hint of what was really going on around them. What was so jarring as to have shocked them out of their waking dream?
