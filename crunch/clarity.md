### Clarity
Clarity is the equivalent of DRYH Discipline. It is the measure of your character's ability to see past the surface of The Lie and perceive the nature of reality. Greater levels of Clarity allow access to new and exciting ways to get yourself mad or dead.

#### 0: "Faceless"
Either a background Extra or running entirely on Madness, characters with no Clarity have no Refresh to avoid Compels against their Aspects; therefore, they are driven entirely by their Nature. Barring drastic intervention to regain Clarity somehow, this is the end for a player character, as they can do nothing but be Compelled.

#### 1: "Extra"
Slightly more perceptive than a "Faceless" but not quite a "Supporting Actor", An "Extra" has enough control over their choices that they can have a chance to pose an impediment to a players actions. A player reduced to 1 Clarity needs to be very careful not to lose any more, as at this point they have a very good chance of either crashing or becoming "Faceless".
