= Effects

== Difficulty

Like any other action, magical actions have a difficulty to succeed against.

One of the only differences is that the GM takes the difficulty of the
particuar set of effects and variables desired, and rolls the fudge dice to
determine the final adjusted value. Magic is somewhat unreliable.
