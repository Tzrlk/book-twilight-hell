# Madness

The Twilight Hell is contradictary at the best of times. The minds trapped within its clutches struggle to make what sense they can of it. The slow erosion of ones' worldview causes a spiral of madness that ends in nothing good.

Madness is represented in play as a stress track, where the amount of boxes is equal to the Character's Clarity + Sanity skill.

## Accumulation

Fortunately, there are few ways to accumulate Madness. Unfortunately, those few are very pervasive, and easy to trigger.

### Domination

If the total result for all Madness dice in a given Challenge is higher than the total for any other type of die, Madness is said to "dominate" the Challenge. If this happens, the Character involved in the Challenge gains a single point of stress on their Madness track, with all the flow-on effects that go with it.

### Contradiction

Aspects are what keep a character safe, and provide consistency in a place where there is none. By declining a Compel on one of their Aspects, a contradiction in their worldview is created, and so they take a point of stress to their Madness track.

### Magic

Some types of magic have the ability to drive someone insane by shattering the protective anima of their ego. Such magical effects work as ordinary combat attacks that target the Madness stress track.

Other types of magic have a cost to them, and said cost is paid in stress on their Madness track. Though, this can frequently be mitigated by invoking one of their pre-existing or acquired delusions.

## Recovery

As with all stress tracks, accumulated stress disappears at the end of a scene, along with any Minor Consequences. Moderate or Severe Consequences require thorough treatment before they can be removed. The only way to remove a Moderate Consequence is to convert an existing Aspect to match or incorporate it.
