= Darkpine

The woods of Darkpine are full of evil, the light of the sun never reaching
the ground. The paths in the forest are safe relative to the certain death of
the trees, but even so, creatures born of nightmare stalk freely. Travel is
necessary to keep the rest of Danjukk supplied, and while trips can be
relatively uneventful, travellers know to leave a bullet spare, just in case.

The world of Danjukk is vast, yet geographically irregular. Darkpine forest is
the only real source of timber for the plateau cities, so named for their
perches atop towering mesas.
