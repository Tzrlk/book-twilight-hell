# A Taste of Terror
An emotional horror LARP.

## Description
The woods of Darkpine are full of evil, the light of the sun never reaching the ground. The paths in the forest are safe relative to the certain death of the trees, but even so, creatures born of nightmare stalk freely. Travel is necessary to keep the rest of Danjukk supplied, and while your trip has been relatively uneventful so far, today an ill wind blows. Leave a bullet spare, you might need it.

## Player Requirements
Costuming: Western-style travellers fare, primarily leather, but there is nothing wrong with cloth.
Equipment: Armament of pistols, rifles and shotguns (Go to the $2 shop and look around for cap-guns if you can. Notify me if you don't have time. I don't really have time, but I'll make some if someone is in dire need). Any other things like water-skins and knives are also a good thing to have. No metal knives.

## Setting
The world of Danjukk is vast, yet geographically irregular. You are all inhabitants of Darkpine forest, the only real source of timber for the plateau cities, so named for their perches atop towering mesas (think Thunder Bluff and/or Mercadia). There are three things you need to worry about living in this world:

Mundane problems
- Sustenance
- Not getting killed by bandits
- Finding someone to have kids with

Undead
- Walking corpses of family, friends.
- Wraiths in the trees

The Wretched
- Sleeping
- Going insane
- Fear

The Wretched are born of fear and delusion. The world around you is psycho-reactive, and highly responsive to negative emotions. Think of it like Nightmare on Elm St, where Freddy is trying to get out of your dreams BEFORE he kills you. If you go insane enough, you don't need to have nightmares, or even sleep for this to happen. This being said, all of you have lived to your respective ages with these problems constantly towering over you. You may be depressed, grizzled, cynical, or even delusional, but it's still an aspect of life. Then again, you've never really gotten into a situation like the one you are headed toward.
